      <h5 class=" fw-normal">Why did we create FFN?</h5>
      <h6 class=" fw-normal">
        The simple answer… We, want to help retail traders get funded and earn a consistent living through trading larger amounts of capital without risking their own money.
        <br><br>As traders that have gone through the testing process time and time
        again, we saw an opportunity to make it better… much better.
        <br><br>
        (The more in depth answer) We as the founders came together with the general idea that we want to build a company that is truly focused on helping traders get funded, instead of just charging a subscription and wishing you the best of luck.
        At FFN, we know that it needs to be much more than that. We sum this up in our core values.

        The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. – Bob Marley.
        <br><br>At FFN, being fair and honest with our traders is the only way we will operate.

        We want to create an environment that is fully transparent, allowing all of our traders to have full faith in the process. How does the testing work? How do I get paid? Are there any erroneous stipulations before I can withdraw money? We are
        an open book. If you have questions that are not addressed on our website, please reach out to us! We want to answer your questions.

        Knowing when to trade and when not to trade, knowing when to enter and when to exit, knowing when to take a walk, or even stop trading for the day. There are ZERO successful traders who don’t practice discipline. (Read that sentence a few
        more times) Not only do we want a network of humble traders, we also want a network of disciplined traders.

        Last but not least, we want to create a network that thrives on accountability, just like you would encounter at a brick and mortar prop desk. Well all need accountability as traders. Trading is you vs. yourself. Having an accountability
        partner/s will stop you from making bad decisions, and will also be there when you need someone to talk to, who understands what you are experiencing as a trader.

    <p class="fs-6" style="color:white">The story is fairly simple… we are just a couple of average Joes that happened to bond over our love of trading. (Jay has been trading and mentoring traders for 10+ years. Jay mentored both Kevin and Kyle which
      is how
      they all met, and began trading together). Each morning we all hop on discord around 8:30, and we trade the same way that we would in a brick and mortar prop firm. Conversation is light, and mostly focused on the products we are trading. Over
      time, we’ve discussed which prop firms we like/dislike etc… Through those conversations, FFN was born. As traders that have been involved with many prop firms over the years we know what is important to us (YOU) as the trader, so we decided to
      create a company based on exactly that. Without the traders, capital cannot be deployed. We want you the trader to be the number one focus. We want you to have clarity on what exactly you’re doing, how it works and how you can be successful.

      <h2>Kevin Stewart</h2>
      <p>I have lived and worked in multiple﻿ countries around the world, and have had different jobs from Securities to the executive of an 8.2 billion-dollar company, and something that I have learned along the way is that people are hunting for
        freedom. They make decisions based on their need for time, or their tolerance for the lack thereof. Trading has given me that, given me my time back, time to spend however I like, where and when I like, and it has the potential to do that for
        others too, and this is where my passion for seeing other people succeed is birthed.</p>

      <h2>Kyle Johns</h2>
      <p>Most of my professional career has been in the real estate investment industry and a large portion of my focus still is because I believe real estate provides a vehicle to build and store wealth. That being said, when I found trading and
        understood that I could leverage others' money to make my own, at my own pace, from where I wanted… I absolutely fell in love with the process of learning (still am) and achieving the results I was looking for. Seeing what trading can do for
        anyone that takes the time to learn is a joy that I want to see as many people experience as possible. Other than trading and real estate I enjoy doing anything outside and spending time with my family.</p>

      <h2>Jacob L Emanuel (Jay)</h2>
      <p>I began a career early on in commercial diving, which taught me the power of routine, discipline, and the ability to make calm, calculated decisions, while under pressure (literally!). An injury cut my career short, around the time the
        “poker boom” was underway, and since I’ve always loved competition and strategy, I spent a ton of time sharpening my game. I studied the statistics/probabilities of the game, and played non-stop. Eventually, after a ton of hard work on my
        game and myself, I was stringing together some consistency. Online-poker in the USA came to a screeching halt, and I shifted my focus toward trading. Many skills/concepts in poker also apply to trading, so the switch just felt right. I was
        lucky enough to have had 2 incredible mentors, one being a former equity-options market maker. For the last decade or so, I’ve been active in derivatives markets, and I’ve spent time working with traders to build their consistency. I am a
        strong proponent of “longevity” being the most important aspect of participating in the markets! When not at the trading desk, I’m enjoying time with my family or I’m at the beach - preferably both!
